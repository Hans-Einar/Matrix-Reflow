# Linux validation

Results are milestone-specific; future milestones are not implied to pass.

## Environment

AlmaLinux 10.2; GCC/G++ 14.3.1; CMake 3.31.8; X11 1.8.10;
libepoxy 1.5.10; FreeType package 2.13.2. GPU: Intel HD 620, Mesa 25.2.7.

## I1-M1

2026-09-11: clean Debug and Release builds passed with GCC, without warnings.
CTest core-smoke passed in both (0.06/0.02 s). The executable links the C core
and reports its default density. A fresh configure with Freetype disabled failed
with an explicit REQUIRED-package diagnostic, as expected. Tests remain active
in Release (no reliance on disabled assert()).
